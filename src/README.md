# csv2es

This is an exploratory project designed to familiarize myself with Rust. The project aims to read data from CSV files and ingest them into an Elasticsearch cluster. By undertaking this initiative, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of Rust's capabilities, particularly in handling file I/O operations and integrating with Elasticsearch.
